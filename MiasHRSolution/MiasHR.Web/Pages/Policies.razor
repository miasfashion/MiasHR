                                        A paid rest break period, consisting of a minimum of ten (10) minutes, is normally
                                        scheduled near the midpoint of each half of a full workday. Non-exempt employees are

                                        more hours overtime in one workday, you are required by law and Company policy to
                                        take an additional paid rest break, consisting of a minimum of ten (10) minutes, at the end

                                        Company expects each employee to conduct himself/herself in a professional and ethical
                                        manner. This means that, among other things, employees are expected to conduct
                                        themselves in a manner that will uphold the Company’s reputation for excellent customer

                                        other disciplinary measures against employees who violate work rules or fail to
                                        satisfactorily perform their job duties. Examples of disciplinary action include a warning

                                        In an effort to alert employees to expectations of them and to apprise them of their
                                        obligations and responsibilities regarding their conduct, listed below are examples of
                                        types of behavior that may result in disciplinary action. The first list is a list of offenses
                                        that typically will be more serious and even result in immediate dismissal. The second list
                                        is a list of offenses that are not as grave but are still likely to result in disciplinary action.
                                        Of course, Company reserves the right to determine appropriate disciplinary action based
                                        on the individual circumstances in its sole discretion. Because we cannot anticipate every
                                        situation that might arise, these lists merely provide examples of problematic conduct.
                                        Company expects employees to always behave lawfully, ethically, and with good sense.

                                    Individuals who believe that they have been the victim of conduct prohibited by this
                                    policy statement or who believe that they have witnessed such conduct should discuss
                                    their concerns with their immediate supervisor, Human Resources or any member of
                                    management or contact Complaint Hotline at (562) 906-1060 x 107.

                                        When possible, Company encourages individuals who believe that they are being
                                        subjected to such conduct to promptly advise the offender that his or her behavior is
                                        unwelcome and request that it be discontinued. Often this action alone will resolve the
                                        problem. Company recognizes, however, that an individual may prefer to pursue the
                                        matter through complaint procedures. Company encourages the prompt reporting of
                                        complaints or concerns so that rapid and constructive action can be taken before
                                        relationships become irreparably strained. Therefore, although no fixed reporting period
                                        has been established, early reporting and intervention have proven to be the most
                                        effective method of resolving actual or perceived incidents of harassment.

                                        promptly. The investigation may include individual interviews with the parties involved
                                        and, where necessary, with individuals who may have observed the alleged conduct or

                                        participating in an investigation of a claim of harassment or discrimination is a serious

                                        disciplinary action. Acts of retaliation should be reported immediately and will be

                                        Bullying may be intentional or unintentional. However, it must be noted that where an

                                        relationships with employees whom they supervise, either directly or indirectly. If an
                                        issue develops in this regard you need to notify your immediate supervisor immediately.
                                        Employees who violate this guideline will be subject to discipline, up to and including

                                        Company also discourages dating of co-workers. Company reserves the right, based on
                                        individual circumstances, to transfer one or both employees to avoid problems that may
                                        arise if co-workers are employed in the same department. If a dating relationship between
                                        co-workers becomes disruptive, or is the basis for employee complaints, Company will
                                        take appropriate corrective action, which may include requesting that one of the
                                        employees, at the choice of the two involved employees, resign their employment with
                                        Company. Company believes that this policy helps to avoid claims of favoritism, office
                                        disruption, and the potential for harassment complaints.

                                            born.

                                            Requests for leave should be made to Manager/President. Before the leave is
                                            approved, the employee may be required to provide medical certification of the
                                            pregnancy-related disability giving rise to a request for a leave of absence. The
                                            employee may also be required to provide periodic updates of her status, such as
                                            the expected date of return and intent to return to work.

                                            this policy, she will be entitled to reinstatement in accordance with the provisions

                                            without working together as a team. Teamwork basically boils down to common courtesy
                                            and common sense. If a co-worker is overloaded and you’re not, help them in any way
                                            you can. It’s only a matter of time before they will return the favor. Pitch in to help a
                                            customer whether they are technically yours or not. If another employee hasn’t quite
                                            caught on to something and you have, ask if you may suggest another way to do it.
                                            Genuine teamwork makes for much more enjoyable and satisfying work experience and
                                            results in happier (and more generous) customers.

                                            procedure, formula, or improvement that has value, and that the President has taken
                                            measures to prevent from becoming available to persons other than those selected by the
                                            President to have access for limited purposes.” Our internal business practices and
                                            procedures are of great value to Company. Employees are not to disclose any proprietary
